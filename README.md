# <Password Generator>

## Description

This password generator creates a fully randomized password and allows us to customize which kind of characters and what length we want the password to be.
When we press Generate password, a prompt pops up asking us how many characters we want the password to have. When we choose a number between 8-128 the application then asks wether we want special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. When we satisfy the criteria for the password the application generates a fully randomized password.
